*  expand region  (SPC-v)

opens up transient state: v = expands, V=contracts, r=reset, e=edit (what does this mean?)

* switch to previous buffer (SPC-tab)

 very useful for rapidly cycling between two windows (for example, .spacemacs and scratch, for when I want to try out lisp code)

* freezing issues

Was having trouble with emacs hanging while initiating swiper searches. I could escape only by issuing a “kill -sigusr2 xxxx” command.

Possible suspects: smooth scrolling, emacs-mac-port, visual-fill-column, visual-wrap, unicode fonts in modeline, powerline scale factor 
 
FIXED: seems to have been the unicode fonts
   dotspacemacs-mode-line-unicode-symbols nil
